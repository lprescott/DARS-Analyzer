# DARS-Analyzer

DARS stands for Degree Audit Reporting System. It is a computer based degree audit system developed by Miami University in Ohio and is in use throughout the country. The audit provides the student and academic adviser an analysis of degree requirements for a particular degree and major. The DARS report displays the courses from which you may select in order to complete specific degree requirements and shows how the courses already taken apply toward those requirements.

### What is a degree audit?

A degree audit is a road map to graduation for a student, instructing them which requirements have been completed and which need to be completed. A degree audit will match a student's academic record against the requirements in a particular degree program. A Biology major degree audit, for example, would report how completed courses and in-progress courses from UAlbany or transfer institutions would apply toward the Biology degree program. In addition, it would report if any of these courses satisfy the General Education Requirement, Writing Intensive Requirement and/or major/minor residence requirements.By running an audit against a specific major, the degree audit will automatically match courses taken by a student in all the requirements in which the courses can be accepted. As the requirements are completed a "+" will appear, a "-" will appear when the requirement is not completed. A degree audit will be used to award a degree.
